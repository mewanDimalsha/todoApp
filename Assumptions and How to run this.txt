Edit Existing Tasks: I tend built this task by using Alert.promt method but it didnot work as I'm using a android Device. Becuase of that I used the implemented methodology in the code.

How to Run this:
1. Unzip the file
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Open the terminal and run the command "npm install"
4. Run the command "expo start" or "npx expo start"
5. Scan the QR code in the browser or in the expo app in your mobile device
6. The app will open in your mobile device
7. You can add a task by clicking the "Add Task" button
8. You can edit a task by clicking the Edit icon
9. You can delete a task by clicking the Delete icon
10. You can mark a task as completed by clicking the checkbox or clicking on the item in the Pending Task list
